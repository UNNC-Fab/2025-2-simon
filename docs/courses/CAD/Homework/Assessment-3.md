## Fusion 360 3D model design
For my 1st 3D model, I created a joystick that moves left and right through a piece of board that fits in a box. The result is shown below.

## Parameters
For this model parameters were created for certain parts of the models as shown below \

Parameter and component 1

## Plugin
I added a plugin from Fusion 360 website called Gridfinity Bin. This is a plugin that creates a premade bin that can be used in the project as long as you set its size. To use it under create select Gridfinity Bin. Then classify its size as shown below Ex:

The parameters of the plugin is shown below:

## Engineer Drawing of Component
Under design in Fusion 360 you can create engineer drawings of the components made shown at different angles and marked size. Picture below shows the engineer drawing of my 1st component.

## SolidWork CAD Software
SolidWork is another 3D design software developed by  Dassault Systèmes. Commonly used in engineering, product design for detailed 3D models. SolidWork is tend to be known for its user friendly interface and allows for simulation and visualization of design accurately. While also offering tools for 2D drawing and motion analysis.
